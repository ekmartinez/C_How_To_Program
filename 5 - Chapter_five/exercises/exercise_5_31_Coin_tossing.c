/*
 * 5.31 (Coin Tossing) Write a program that simulates coin tossing. For each toss of the coin the
program should print Heads or Tails. Let the program toss the coin 100 times, and count the num-
ber of times each side of the coin appears. Print the results. The program should call a separate func-
tion flip that takes no arguments and returns 0 for tails and 1 for heads. [Note: If the program
realistically simulates the coin tossing, then each side of the coin should appear approximately half
the time for a total of approximately 50 heads and 50 tails.]
